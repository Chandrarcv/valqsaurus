"},{title:"Conducting what-if analysis",type:0,sectionRef:"#",url:"docs/general/conducting-what-if",content:"One of the main aspects of the valQ Custom Visual is to be able to simulate the impacts changes to key drivers such as prices have on the full year forecast. As we can\u2019t change the past, such a simulated change should only be applied to future period. The valQ Custom Visual have this capability. When performing what-if analysis, the period that a simulation should be applied from is selected in the Side Panel (current period is default):Assuming that we calculate fuel cost based on litre per month and price as $/l and we are at the end of period 9, the simulated cost should be calculated first at the monthly level with the % change applied to period 9 and onwards. Once the individual months are calculated, they can then be aggregated based on the rule of the node (sum for diesel cost, weighted average for diesel price):When hovering over a node, the bottom half of the node becomes a slider. Drag the slider left to vary the node by a negatively, drag right for positive. As you drag, the values for the selected node is dynamically recalculated and displayed. When releasing, the tree will immediately recalculate all dependent nodes and show the result.A simulation change is either a pct. Change, a fixed future price or a pct. Growth depending on the simulation model defined for the value driver.The default method for the driver can be seen on the simulation tooltip. You can also change the selected model by selecting at the bottom of the tooltip.Understanding that a change is applied to the selected periods only is particularly important to understand when displaying the Full Year value and the node is using a weighted average. The displayed value is the weighted average value for the full year, not the value for future periods.A simplified example will help understanding this critical concept. Let\u2019s assume that the diesel price is $1.014 for all periods and the monthly fuel consumption is constant as well at 1m litres and we have selected period 9 as we want to apply the simulation to the remaining periods of the year.We now drag the slider for the fuel price to the right and the node will show the new weighted average value. Let\u2019s say we drag it to the right so the full year weighted average is $1.030. As the first 8 periods were $1.014, the weighted average of $1.030 means that the simulated price change is equivalent of a future fuel price of $1.20. To better understand the individual future period simulations when looking a Full Year aggregated number, it is useful to pay attention to the Month Data also shown on the node. The real world is a little more complex as the price is not necessarily the same every month and the fuel consumed is unlikely to be constant as well. Below is an example of such a simulation based on a real data set:The weighted average price was 1.014. We now simulated a 2% increase in the prices selected and future periods which equates to a new weighted average price of 1.030. If you look at the month Value, you can see for the selected month, this equates to the higher price of 1.195.Multiple variations can be applied in parallel as they are expressed as pct. The top left % indicate the cumulative impact on this particular node of all simulation that impacts it.Any node with a variation will have the blue pen icon in the top middle showing the percentage the node has been varied with. For quick what-if analysis at any level and a dynamic work process from the general to the specific, you can apply a simulation on any level.Certain nodes may have been locked from changes in the model. This is generally when there is a specific reason not to vary this node directly for consistency purposes. A locked node will not have the grey pen iconor a slider when hovering.Certain nodes may be displayed multiple times in the tree. An example is Material Moved as it affects Mining and Mill Throughput. In these scenarios, one node is linked to the other. If you simulate a change in a linked node, the node it is pointing to is instead changed so it applies both to the selected node and anywhere else where the driver is used. If a node is a linked node, it has the Linked node text in the bottom right corner:"},{title:"General features of ValQ Custom Visual",type:0,sectionRef:"#",url:"docs/general/getting-started",content:""},{title:"Instructions for valQ Custom Visual",type:1,pageTitle:"General features of ValQ Custom Visual",url:"docs/general/getting-started#instructions-for-valq-custom-visual",content:"The valQ Custom Visual provides various components that the Designer can use in conjunction with Microsoft Power BI.

When you open a valQ Custom Visual, it will open in a similar manner at the screenshot below:  The left panel is the navigation panel and on the canvas you will find the value driver tree. By default, the tree is open on collapsed mode at a level defined by the designer. This is typically completely collapsed. As part of the New Release, you will be able to hide the Navigation Panel in the Runtime by clicking the Collapse button as shown in the below Figure.

This would typically be 1 year by 12 months or a multiyear view like 5 years plan by year. The selecting of the time series will often be based on Filters or Variables. A typical scenario is where the designer has defined 4 variables on the underlying data sources: Primary: Version: ie. Defaulted to Forecast Year: ie. Defaulted to Current Year Comparison: Version ie. Defaulted to Budget Year ie. Defaulted to Current Year This allows the users to compare different versions and years in the value driver tree model. The valQ Custom Visual can display individual periods but can also apply time aggregation such as Full Year, Year-to-Date.

The designer can link certain nodes to a user selected scaling. You can select the scale you wish to display by selecting this under the Value Display section. Note that the options here can be configured so they may differ. It is important to note that not all notes are scaled using this as the value driver tree typically contains both amounts, prices, rates and physical volumes. In addition to the primary display value, the designer can also choose a secondary value to be displayed. I.e. if you are showing Full Year as primary, in the below example, it has been configured to visualize the Month data as secondary:  The time aggregation and display relates to the Simulation Period selected. When Month is selected, it shows the first month of the simulation interval selected. By default, the simulation period is the selected period and the future. This is an important concept as when we simulate, we generally don\u2019t want to apply a change to the past as we can\u2019t change it.

Assuming a 'Member' from the workspace simulates on the existing scenario, creates a new scenario, deletes another node, comments on the changes made, and saves the model. Once you log back in, all the changes in the ValQ model made by the member are available for viewing.  The changes at a Model/Scenario level are captured at the History Log. The comments between the users are displayed at a Node-Scenario level under the 'Comments' icon.  #5. Export Lastly, you can also export all the data values (baseline, comparison, and scenario data) fed and generated at ValQ. You can export by clicking the 'Export as datasource' option at the additional options dropdown.  Click on the data values you would like to export at the popup.  Click 'Download CSV' (through Power BI Service) or copy-paste the URLs into Excel (through Power BI Desktop)  In Excel, the copied URLs are fed into the 'From Web' - 'Advanced' window to generate the exported data.  6. Live Syncing export with the ValQ model ---------------------------------------Users can also run further simulations to their scenarios and instantly synchronize the new data at the export file by refreshing the data query within 'Queries & Connections'.
