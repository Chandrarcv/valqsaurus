Click on the Plan icon as highlighted in the image below to open the Plan tab. When you access the Plan tab for the very first time,
ValQ allows you to Lock your model before creating a new plan. Locking your model ensures the following:
</div> <br />

 - The structure of your model, the nodes and configuration on it are fixed 
 - The changes made to the plan are not disrupted while planning  

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In this regard, ValQ gives you a warning message saying 'Any changes made in the model will re-calculate all the allocations in each series
and archive the previous steps'. Therefore, we recommend you to completely build your model before you begin to plan.

  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

The following are the steps to access plan on ValQ:

 1. Click on the Lock button once you are ready to plan 
 2. Enter the name of the series under Series Name text box
 3. Choose the series to start with from the drop-down list
 4. Select the period for which you want to plan from the Periods option  

### Plan using existing series

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below example, after locking the model, we have named the series as New Series 1 (default name), selected Baseline as the series to start planning for Periods
Jan-Dec.

> **Note** <br />
Plan tab cannot access Scenarios from Simulate tab as a series to plan on ValQ
 
<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The below Figure shows the result on the Plan screen. You can use the slider to view the rest of the periods.

### Plan from scratch

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
You can plan from scratch by selecting the 'Empty Series' option from Choose series to start with drop-down. However, the Periods option is disabled
when choosing the Empty Series option. ValQ takes the number of periods and period labels from the Data Series Manager setting available under
the Model tab. Empty Series brings in only the structure of the model built using the Model tab and not the node values.
</div> <br />

Here's an example using the Empty Series option
