## Advanced options

Advanced options let's you choose the Forecasting Method, Distribution Method after configuring the 
Target and Forecast Basis options.

Let's understand how ValQ performs time series forecasting with an example to predict 2020 results.

### 1. Auto Forecast

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Auto Forecast option automatically makes prediction of Target Node for the Target Period based on Past Data Series & Weights and
Source Periods. Growth component can be added as absolute value or percentage growth when needed. This option does not need
Distribution Method as ValQ performs time series forecasting automatically.
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In the below example, forecasting is done for node 'Overall Result' for the year 2020 based on 2019 actuals data with weight as 1
and growth not incorporated. 
</div> <br />

**Configuration for Forecasting**

<img alt="ValQ logo" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/plan/tsf3.1.png')} />
  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The below figure shows the results of Auto Forecasting as per the above configuration with three choices of forecast i.e.
Optimized, Balanced and Conservative. Notice that the Net Growth of Conservative is 0.00% as we didn't add growth in the Forecast
Basis option.
</div> <br />

  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Here's another example where forecasting is done for node 'Overall Result' for the year 2020 based on 2019 and 2018 actuals with
weight as 2 and 1 respectively and 10% growth. Auto Forecast is the Forecast Method applied in this example. 
</div> <br />

  </Zoom>
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
The below figure shows the results of Auto Forecasting as per the above configuration with three choices of forecast i.e.
Optimized, Balanced and Conservative. Notice that the Net Growth of Conservative is 10% as we have added 10% growth in 
the Forecast Basis option.
</div> <br />

### 2. Linear Trend

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Linear Trend method applies Linar Regression to make prediction of Target Node for the Target Period based on Past Data Series
& Weights and Source Periods. Growth component can be added as absolute value or percentage growth when needed and 
Distribution Method can selected as Match or M2M(+1).
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In this example forecasting is done for node 'Overall Result' for the year 2020 based on 2019 and 2018 actuals with
weight as 2 and 1 respectively and 10% growth. The Forecast Method applied in this example is Linear Trend with M2M as Distribution Method.

### 3. Moving Average

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Moving Average method computes forecast results of Target Node for the Target Period based on Past Data Series
& Weights and Source Periods. This method makes prediction by calculating Moving Average of Past Data Series period values. Growth component can be
added as absolute value or percentage growth when needed and Distribution Method can selected as Match or M2M(+1).
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In this example forecasting is done for node 'Overall Result' for the year 2020 based on 2019 and 2018 actuals with
weight as 2 and 1 respectively and 10% growth. The Forecast Method applied in this example is Moving Average with M2M as Distribution Method.

### 4. Weighted Moving Average

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
Weighted Moving Average method computes forecast results of Target Node for the Target Period based on Past Data Series
& Weights and Source Periods. This method makes prediction by calculating Weighted Moving Average of Past Data Series period values
with weights applied to it. Growth component can be
added as absolute value or percentage growth when needed and Distribution Method can selected as Match or M2M(+1).
</div> <br />

<div style={{textAlign: 'justify'}}>
In this example forecasting is done for node 'Overall Result' for the year 2020 based on 2019 and 2018 actuals with
weight as 2 and 1 respectively and 10% growth. The Forecast Method applied in this example is Weighted Moving Average
with M2M as Distribution Method.
