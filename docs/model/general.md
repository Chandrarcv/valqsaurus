The saved file can be exported and this exported file can be used in the
“Import from Excel” option in “Import an Advanced Model” tab (`Refer
Section: Import from an Export File <IEF>`).

## Writeback

You will be able to export the Scenarios configured in the valQ through
an URL by entering the Writeback URL in the Text Box (see Figure below).

The different simulations of planning results can be written back to the
underlying systems using the URL exposed as part of the valQ. Using the
URL, the user can do write-back scenario nodes to the underlying system.
