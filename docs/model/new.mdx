## Create a Simple Model

Using this option, it is very simple for the beginners to create a tree
automatically based on their own data source. By clicking the Create a
Simple Model option, you will be able to view the valQ screen as shown
in the below Figure.

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Simple Dynamic Tree created with one single
Measure" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.26.png')} />
  </Zoom>

By default, the Measure “Actual” has been selected as a Mandatory
criteria for getting the Tree widget. Now you can select the other
Measures and Dimensions based on your choice as indicated in the Figure
below.

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Simple Dynamic Tree created with Measures and
Dimensions" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.27.png')} />
  </Zoom>

From the above Figure, you can observe that the other Measure “Forecast”
is assigned to “Value” and the Dimensions namely Account and Product has
been assigned to the “tab” and the Period\_MON is assigned to “Time
period”. Now based the assigned data source, the Tree is being
configured. Hence now you can create a tree directly from your data. For
step by step instructions on how to get started to build a Dynamic
Model, please follow this link:
[https://ValQ.com/wp-content/uploads/valq-for-microsoft-power-bi-beginners-tutorial.pdf](https://ValQ.com/wp-content/uploads/valq-for-microsoft-power-bi-beginners-tutorial.pdf).

**Note**: For Dynamic Model, you will be able to view the Root Node and
first three Nodes in the next level hierarchy under the Sub Models
section of the Navigation Panel (see Figure below).

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Sub Models Section showing the Root Node and first three Nodes in the
next level hierarchy" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/dsm.png')} />
  </Zoom>

#### Read only Dynamic Tree in Editor

When Dynamic Model is selected, you will be able to only view the value
driver tree with Parent and Children Nodes and you cannot undergo any
configuration part on it. But you can generate a copy of the Parent Node
and proceed with configuration part based on your choice (see Figure
below).

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Read Only Dynamic Tree" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.28.png')} />
  </Zoom>

#### Dynamic Scaling on Dynamic Tree

Based on your data source, the value driver tree will get generated and
the Number Scaling for all the Nodes will be updated appropriately based
on the data source (see Figure below). For our example, the Number
Scaling is “0.0b”.

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Dynamic Scaling on Dynamic Tree" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.29.png')} />
  </Zoom>

As part of the New Release, you have the option to convert the Dynamic
Model to an Advanced Model (see Figure below).

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Option for converting Dynamic Model to an Advanced
Model" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/conv1.png')} />
  </Zoom>

When the option is clicked, now you will be prompted for the Message
window as shown below.

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Confirmation Message" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/conv1a.png')} />
  </Zoom>

After clicking Yes, you will be able to edit the configuration for all
the level of Nodes similar to the Advance Model (see Figure below).

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Dynamic Model converted to an Advanced Model" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/conv2.png')} />
  </Zoom>

## Create an Advanced Model

This option is used to create a Tree in valQ manually Node by Node based
on your choice. By clicking the Create New from Scratch option, you will
be able to view the valQ screen as shown in the below Figure.

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Create New from Scratch" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.38.png')} />
  </Zoom>

For our example we have created a Parent Node and two child Nodes (see
Figure below).

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Tree with one Parent Node and two Child Nodes" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.39.png')} />
  </Zoom>

Now with the help of `Section: Open a Sample Model <OSM>`, you will be
able to configure the General, Configuration, Display, Simulation,
Business Definition and Conditional Formatting settings for the Tree
(Please refer <Link to={useBaseUrl('/docs/general/getting-started')}> `Section: Open a Sample Model <OSM>` </Link>  for more details).

## Import an Advanced Model

Using the “Import an Advanced Model” option, you will be able to import
data through two different options as shown below.

  <Zoom>
<img alt="valQ – Import from Excel" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.30.png')} />
  </Zoom>

### Import from Excel

Using the option “Import from Excel”, you will be able to paste the JSON
File Data Format text into the Text Editor as shown in the below Figure.

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Configuration Data from Excel Format" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.31.png')} />
  </Zoom>

Now based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Tree
formed with Nodes in the valQ screen.

  <Zoom>
<img alt="valQ screen derived from Excel Data" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.32.png')} />
  </Zoom>

As part of the New Release, you will be able to retain the existing
Navigation Panel configuration and apply the same for the next Tree
configuration. For our example, the Figure below shows the Navigation
panel for the first Tree configuration.

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Navigation Panel for the first tree configuration" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.33.png')} />
  </Zoom>

Now navigate to the Import an Advanced Model option in New Tab and paste
the JSON File Data Format text for the second tree into the Text Editor
as shown in the below Figure.

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Import a Tree" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.34.png')} />
  </Zoom>

Now select the option “I am reimporting the current model – retain my
settings” so that you will able to view the second tree configuration
being applied with the Navigation Panel settings already configured for
the first tree (see Figure below).

  <Zoom>
<img alt="Navigation Panel for the second tree configuration" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.35.png')} />
  </Zoom>

### Import from an Export File

Using this option “Import from an Export File”, you will be able to
paste the Export file data format from an already exported tree data as
shown in the below Figure. This Export File will be generated by
navigating to the Settings Tab and by clicking the Export button.

<Zoom>
<img alt="Configuration Data from Export File Data Format" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.36.png')} />
</Zoom>

Now based on the above configuration, you will be able to view the Tree
formed with Nodes in the valQ screen.

<Zoom>
<img alt="valQ screen derived from Export File Data Format" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images/12.37.png')} />
