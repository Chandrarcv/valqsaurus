The starting point for a simulation is a selection of two versions
-**Primary Version** and a **Comparison Version** and a year. For
instance a forecast vs current budget.

Once we start simulating, changes are applied to the primary version. We
call this changing version the Simulation.

To understand the improvements we achieve, we also keep track of the
original values from the primary version without simulation changes. We
therefore have 3 data series in the model that we calculate and compare:

1.  Simulation (The Primary Version including applied variations)
2.  Original (The Primary Version without variations)
3.  Target (The Comparison Version)

Based on the above, we calculate the following variances:

  - Simulated Variance (Simulation vs Target)

Q: If we changed these things, would we hit target?

  - Simulation Impact (Simulation vs Original)

Q: How much would we improve if we made these changes?

  - Original Variance (Original vs. Target)

Q: What was our variance if we did nothing?
