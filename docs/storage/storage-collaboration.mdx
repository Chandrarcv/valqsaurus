# Storage and Collaboration

You can use this enhancement on the product to upload, save & store,
audit, comment, and collaborate on your model. You can also export
and/or run further analysis on the baseline, comparison, and the
simulated data series available across the entire model.

## 1\. Uploading the ValQ Model

After logging in to the relevant workspace, you can see the 'Upload'
button and your profile icon at the bezel.

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images//SC5.2.png')} />
In the screenshot model, lets assume you delete a node `Ryan Smith`

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images//SC5.3.png')} />
Lets also assume you simulate on the node `Chris Morris`

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images//SC5.4.png')} />
You can save these changes at the workspace by clicking 'Upload' near
your profile icon, naming your model, and clicking 'upload' at the popup
window.

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images//SC5.5.png')} />
Once your model is uploaded, you can see additional icons at the bezel
such as Save, Comments, and additional options having Exporting, History
log, & Settings.

## 2\. Commenting

You can comment on the changes you have made by clicking the 'Comment'
icon on top of the node. After posting, your comment is saved alongside
your username and time log.

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images//SC5.8.png')} />

Alternatively, you can check the comment log for the entire model by
clicking 'Comments' icon at the bezel. Comments are displayed at a
Scenario-Node level.

## 3\. History Log

As you go to additional options and click 'History Log', you can see the
model and scenario level changes made in a chronological order. This
feature helps with auditing the ValQ model.

## 4\. Collaboration

After saving, you can collaborate on your model changes with other users
under the same workspace. Assuming a 'Member' from the workspace
simulates on the existing scenario, creates a new scenario, deletes
another node, comments on the changes made, and saves the model.

Once you log back in, all the changes in the ValQ model made by the
member are available for viewing.

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images//SC5.11.png')} />

The changes at a Model/Scenario level are captured at the History Log.
The comments between the users are displayed at a Node-Scenario level
under the 'Comments' icon.

## 5\. Export

Lastly, you can also export all the data values (baseline, comparison,
and scenario data) fed and generated at ValQ. You can export by clicking
the 'Export as datasource' option at the additional options dropdown.

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images//SC5.16.png')} />

Click on the data values you would like to export at the popup.

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images//SC5.14.png')} />

Click 'Download CSV' (through Power BI Service) or copy-paste the URLs
into Excel (through Power BI Desktop)

<img alt="" src={useBaseUrl('/doc-images//SC5.15.png')} />

In Excel, the copied URLs are fed into the 'From Web' - 'Advanced'
window to generate the exported data.

6\. Live Syncing export with the ValQ model
---------------------------------------Users can also run further
simulations to their scenarios and instantly synchronize the new data at
the export file by refreshing the data query within 'Queries &
Connections'.
