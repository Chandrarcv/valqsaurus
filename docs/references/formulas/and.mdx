An AND statement returns a TRUE value if ALL the arguments are TRUE. 
## Syntax
AND ( logical_test1, [logical_test2], ... )
## Arguments
logical_test1 – The first condition to be evaluated. This is a required argument.

logical_test2, …  – The additional conditions to be evaluated. These are optional arguments.
## Example
Consider a scenario in which if the number of licenses is greater than 500 and usage period is greater than 24 months, then the price should be $20 else $25.

To achieve this, the formula should be IF(AND(Num_of_Licenses>500,Duration<24),20,25).
