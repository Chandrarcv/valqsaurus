title: IF
---

An `IF` statement returns a value depending on whether the condition that is being evaluated is TRUE or FALSE. 

## Syntax
```javascript
IF( logical_test, value_if_true, value_if_false )
```
## Arguments
`logical_test` – The condition to be evaluated

`value_if_true` – The value that is to be returned if the condition is met

`value_if_false` – The value that is to be returned if the condition is not met

## Example
Consider the Demand and Inventory nodes to follow the trend as shown below. The node [Demand - Inventory] is to be calculated as Demand - Inventory, if the value is positive, else it should be zero.

| Parameter          | Week 1 | Week 2 |Week 3  |Week 4  |
|--------------------|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| Demand             | 110    | 95     | 75     | 78     |
| Inventory          | 85     | 70     | 100    | 80     |
| Demand - Inventory | 25     | 25     | 0      | 0      |


To achieve this, the formula should be 
```javascript
IF(Demand - Inventory > 0, Demand - Inventory, 0)
```
