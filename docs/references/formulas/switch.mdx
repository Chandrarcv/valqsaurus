A SWITCH statement evaluates an expression against a list of values and returns the result corresponding to the first matching value. If there is no match, an optional default value is returned.

## Syntax
SWITCH ( expression, value1, result1, value2, result2, ... value_n, result_n, [default] )

## Arguments
expression – The statement to be evaluated

value1, value2, … value_n – The value that is to be compared against the expression

result1, result2, … result_n – The value that is to be returned if the expression matches with any of the values in the argument list

default – The default value that is to be returned if the expression does not match with any of the values in the argument list

## Example
Consider a scenario in which the node Discount Rate is to be calculated based on the current month. Months Jan, Aug, Nov and Dec should have 15% as the discount rate whereas the remaining months should have 10%.

| Month         | Jan | Feb | Mar | Apr | May | Jun | Jul | Aug | Sep | Oct | Nov | Dec |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Discount Rate | 15% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 10% | 15% | 10% | 10% | 15% | 15% |

This can be achieved by using the SWITCH function in the following manner.

SWITCH(CURRENT_PERIOD_INDEX,1,15,2,10,3,10,4,10,5,10,6,10,7,10,8,15,9,10,10,10,11,15,12,15)
